# MVC-Tech-Blog

This is a CMS style blog site where developers can publish new posts, and leave comments. It is built using the MVC architectural structure with handlebars.js as the templating language, sequelize as the ORM, and npm express-session package for authentication.

Below is a screenshot picture of what some of the features and execution would look like.
